# password-generator

## Description

I created this project to help people who desire a truly random password experience.
Using this password generator insures big tech and shady folks alike keep their fingers out of your passwords.
It was created by randomizing an array that contains the user's desired password parameters.
Its simplicity and elegance taught me much about how JavaScript works.

## Tests

To test the randomness of the generator I recommend creating a password consisting of every character and graphing the amount of times each character appears to test the distribution.
